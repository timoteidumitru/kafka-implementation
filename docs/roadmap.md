# Modernization Roadmap: Event-Driven Order Processing Platform

## Phase 0 — Prep Work ✅

**Goal:** Ensure your environment is ready.

**Tasks:**

* Java 21+ / Spring Boot 3+
* Docker + Docker Compose for MySQL, Kafka, Zookeeper, Eureka
* IDE setup (IntelliJ / VSCode)
* Git repository with modular structure:

  ```
  payment-service/
  order-service/
  inventory-service/
  notification-service/
  api-gateway/
  eureka-server/
  shared-models/
  ```

---

## Phase 1 — Payment Service (Day 1–2) ✅

**Goal:** Modernize Payment Service to be event-driven.

**Tasks:**

* Refactor `PaymentService`:

    * React to `OrderCreatedEvent`
    * Emit `PaymentCompletedEvent` / `PaymentFailedEvent`
    * Implement `IdempotencyGuard`
* Remove controller (optional, for testing only)
* Configure Kafka producers and consumers
* Ensure JSON serialization for `DomainEvent`

**Outcome:** Payment Service fully integrated into the event-driven saga.

---

## Phase 2 — Inventory Service (Day 3–4) ✅

**Goal:** Modernize Inventory Service to react to Payment events.

**Tasks:**

* Implement Inventory business logic (reserve/release stock)
* Kafka consumer for `PaymentCompletedEvent` → reserve stock → publish `InventoryReservedEvent`
* Kafka consumer for `PaymentFailedEvent` → handle compensation
* IdempotencyGuard for event processing
* Optional REST controller for testing

**Outcome:** Inventory Service reacts to payments and participates in the saga.

---

## Phase 3 — Order Service (Day 5–6)

**Goal:** Make Order Service the saga initiator.

**Tasks:**

* OrderController for client API
* OrderService logic:

    * Validate order → publish `OrderCreatedEvent`
    * React to compensating events (PaymentFailed, InventoryFailed) → cancel/rollback order
* Publish events to `order.events` Kafka topic

**Outcome:** Order Service drives the saga; reacts to downstream events.

---

## Phase 4 — Notification Service (Day 7)

**Goal:** Notify users asynchronously about payment and inventory status.

**Tasks:**

* Kafka consumers:

    * `PaymentCompletedEvent` → notify success
    * `PaymentFailedEvent` → notify failure
    * `InventoryReservedEvent` → notify shipping readiness
* Optional integration with email/SMS

**Outcome:** Users are informed asynchronously about all key events.

---

## Phase 5 — API Gateway & Eureka (Day 8)

**Goal:** Provide single entry point and service discovery.

**Tasks:**

* Spring Cloud Gateway configuration
* Fan-out requests where needed
* Integrate with Eureka for service discovery
* Expose only endpoints required for clients (e.g., create order)

**Outcome:** Gateway routes requests and services discoverable.

---

## Phase 6 — Resilience & Backpressure (Day 9)

**Goal:** Make system robust under load and failures.

**Tasks:**

* Add Resilience4j for:

    * Circuit breakers
    * Retries
    * Bulkheads
* Kafka dead-letter topics for failed events
* API Gateway throttling / rate limiting
* Consumer concurrency tuning to handle high-throughput

**Outcome:** System handles failures gracefully and prevents overload.

---

## Phase 7 — Observability & Monitoring (Day 10)

**Goal:** Trace and monitor the full saga.

**Tasks:**

* Structured logs (SLF4J / Logback)
* Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry / Spring Sleuth)
* Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards
* Kafka metrics: consumer lag, throughput
* Optional Zipkin integration for end-to-end tracing

**Outcome:** Full observability for events, consumers, and services.

---

## Phase 8 — End-to-End Testing & Tuning (Day 11–12)

**Goal:** Verify the full system under real workloads.

**Tasks:**

* Docker Compose setup with MySQL, Kafka, Zookeeper, Eureka
* Create test orders → watch events flow through Payment → Inventory → Notification
* Simulate failures → verify compensation works
* Benchmark throughput → adjust partitions, concurrency, and backpressure settings

**Outcome:** System is production-ready and high-throughput.

---

## Phase 9 — Optional Enhancements (Day 13+)

**Tasks:**

* Add Identity/Authorization Service
* Archival service for processed events
* Retry policies per event type
* Advanced notifications (email, SMS, push)

**Outcome:** Extra production-grade features.
